  The inspiration from this artwork comes from the Omega illusion created by sunlight refracting through warm air just above the water.

      <strong>The pen-plotted artwork</strong>
    </h3>

    <p class="text-light-gray mb-4">
      The original artwork was conceived as a still image. The physical piece has the following attributes:<br/><br/>
      — Created from algorithms and rules using the Processing software.<br/><br/>
      — Output printed on 11x11" Bristol paper ( 270g/m2 ) using a 0.2mm rOtring pen with black archival ink.
    </p>

    <p>
      A limited edition print of the artwork is optionally included for the first buyer of the NFT on <a href="https://foundation.app/@bustavo/bustavo/2" target="_blank">Foundation</a> ( see below ).
    </p>

      <strong>The animated NFT artwork</strong>
    </h3>

    <p class="text-light-gray mb-4">
      As inspiration from the pen-plotted artwork, I created a digital animated NFT.
    </p>

    <p>
      The animated version was also created on Processing adding a looping mechanism to the code to achieve subtle variations between each of the frames.
    </p>

    <p>
      The animation will be available on Foundation until auctioned:<br/>
      <a href="https://foundation.app/@bustavo/bustavo/2" target="_blank">Omega NFT on Foundation</a><br/><br/>
      The NFT optionally includes a physical limited edition pen-plotted print of the artwork shown above with important considerations as indicated on the NFT sale page.
